You have to create an add function that is a promise. It will receive 2 parameters that will be two numbers.

It must have the standard structure of a promise, and it will do a validation that if you don't receive numbers in the parameter, you will reject the promise with the following message **"not numbers"**.

If everything is ok, you should save the result of the sum in this pattern in the document called **result.txt**
